Measurement replicated from Hinde, Robert A., and L. A. Barden. 1985. ‘The Evolution of the Teddy Bear’. Animal Behaviour 33 (4): 1371–73. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472(85)80205-0.

Pictures from the « Les arts décoratifs collection » database, available at http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr.

Measurement were made using Gimp measurement tools. Calibrating measurement were made from real life teddy bears.

Picture_Name : Name of the picture in the database.
Year: Year on manufacture.
IRL : Measured in person, in cm. Only applies to a few bears, named Teddy_X.
M1 : First computer measure, using gimp measuring tool, in pixels.
M2 : Second computer measure, using gimp measuring tool, in pixels.
M1 and M2 were measured by different person.
eyes_to_crown : eyes to crown measure.
eyes_to_base_of_head : eyes to base of head measure.
ratio_1 : ratio of eyes_to_crown divided by eyes_to_base_of_head.
angle : estimated orientation of the teddy bear from the axis of the camera, in radian.
tip_of_snout_to_back_of_head : tip of snoot to back of head measure. Not available for all teddy bears due to inadapted pictures.
corrected_tip_of_snout_to_back_of_head : tip_of_snout_to_back_of_head divided by cosine(angle), in order to correct the orientation of the bear.
top_of_head_to_base : top of head to base measure. Not available for all teddy bears due to unadapted pictures.
ratio_2 : ratio of tip_of_snout_to_back_of_head by top_of_head_to_base.

Comments : The difference in measurement between the two measurements for the first ratio is centered around 0. The difference in measurement between the two measurements for the seconde ratio indicates a very high amount of noise. IRL calibration shows measuring ratio 2 using pictures is quite inaccurate, whereas measuring ratio 1 is satisfactory.
